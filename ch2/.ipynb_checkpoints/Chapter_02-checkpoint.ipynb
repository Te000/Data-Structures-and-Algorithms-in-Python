For example, `Vector([4, 7, 5])` would produce a three-dimensional vector with coordinates `<4, 7, 5>`. Modify the constructor so that either of these form is acceptable; that is, if a single integer is sent, it produces a vector of that dimension with all zeros, but if a sequence of numbers is provided, it produces a vector with coordinates based on that sequence."

    "Copied from: https://www.ianswer4u.com/2017/09/oops-inheritance-advantages.html?m=1\n",
    "- The main disadvantage of the inheritance is that the two classes(base class and super class) are tightly coupled that is the classes are dependent on each other.\n",
    "- If the functionality of the base class is changed then the changes have to be done on the child classes also.\n",
    "- If the methods in the super class are deleted then it is very difficult to maintain the functionality of the child class which has implemented the super class’s method.\n",
    "- It increases the time and efforts take to jump through different levels of the inheritance - super() may be called many times over in a deep inheritance tree when calling the constructor for the deepest class.\n",

The class also receives implicit support of the Boolean test, `k in r` for Range `r`.

    "Write a Python program to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures, **bears** and **fish**. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as a relatively large list. Each element of the list should be a `Bear` object, a `Fish` object, or `None`. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the list. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish died (i.e., it disappears)."

    "Develop an inheritance hierarchy based upon a Polygon class that has abstract methods area( ) and perimeter( ). Implement classes Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon that extend this base class, with the obvious meanings for the area( ) and perimeter( ) methods. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectan- gle, and Square, that have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple program that allows users to create polygons of the various types and input their geometric dimensions, and the program then outputs their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two such polygons are similar.\n",
