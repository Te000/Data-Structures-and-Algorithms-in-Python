Also, let us assume that growing the array from size k to size 2k requires k cyber- dollars for the time spent initializing the new array. We shall charge each append operation three cyber-dollars. Thus, we overcharge each append operation that does not cause an overflow by two cyber-dollars. Think of the two cyber-dollars profited in an insertion that does not grow the array as being “stored” with the cell in which the element was inserted. An overflow occurs when the array S has 2i elements, for some integer i ≥ 0, and the size of the array used by the array representing S is 2i. Thus, doubling the size of the array will require 2i cyber-dollars. Fortunately, these cyber-dollars can be found stored in cells 2i−1 through 2i − 1. (See Figure 5.14.) Note that the previous overflow occurred when the number of elements became larger than 2i−1 for the first time, and thus the cyber-dollars stored in cells 2i−1 through 2i − 1 have not yet been spent. Therefore, we have a valid amortization scheme in which each operation is charged three cyber-dollars and all the comput- ing time is paid for. That is, we can pay for the execution of n append operations using 3n cyber-dollars. In other words, the amortized running time of each append operation is O(1); hence, the total running time of n append operations is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>New Justification</b>: If we need 3k cyber dollars now for doubling the array, we need to charge more for each append operation to make up for the total cost of 3k. We only have k/2 operations since the array is always half-filled (except base case when array is just initialised)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, k/2 operations * append cost = 3k. Append cost = 6."

    "Our implementation of insert for the `DynamicArray` class, as given below, has the following inefficiency. in the case when a resize occurs, the resize operation takes time to copy all the elements from an old array to a new array, and then the subsequent loop in the body of `insert` shifts many of those elements. Give an improved implementation of the `insert` method, so that, in the case of a resize, the elements are shifted into their final position during that operation, thereby avoiding the subsequent shifting."
